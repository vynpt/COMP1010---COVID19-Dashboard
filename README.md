COVID-19 is spreading across the world and is changing the world. The coronavirus pandemic is far from over and leaving severe challenges to many countries, including Vietnam with a population of nearly 100 million. As such, all Vietnamese people are in need of more statistics and analysis about the COVID-19 counts to get updates on the surrounding their lives.
 
For this project, we implement a live dashboard for the COVID-19 situation in Vietnam. Our entire product is hosted on an interactive website. The dashboard presents the daily counts of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths in Vietnam. For the users to get and analyze information easily, there are statistics of the total number of COVID-19 cases and vaccinated people as well as tables and charts showing the cases and deaths among days in Vietnam.
